## Basics

These tests are for an SMD assembled PiUpid board 19260^0 which may be referred to as a Unit Under Test (UUT). If the UUT fails and can be reworked then do so, otherwise it needs to be scraped. 

**Warning: never use a soldering iron to rework ceramic capacitors due to the thermal shock.**

## Assembly check

After assembly check the circuit carefully to make sure all parts are soldered and correct. The device marking is used as the part name on the schematic and assembly drawing. Check the bill of materials to figure out what the device is.


## IC Solder Test

Check continuity between pin and pad by measuring the reverse body diode drop from 0V (aka ground) and all other IC pads not connected to 0V. This value will vary somewhat depending on what the pin does, but there is typically an ESD diode to ground or sometimes a body diode (e.g. open drain MOSFET), thus a value of .4V to .7V is valid to indicate a solder connection.
