License Exception:

Even though PiUpdi (product) in general is covered by the Licenses, 
this does *not* cover the so-called "applications" that use product 
"bootloader" or "UPDI" service by means of a jump table or access port 
provided exactly for the purpose - this is merely considered normal 
use of the product, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".

The header files define the interfaces.  Including these (unmodified) header 
files in another file is considered normal use of the product, and does 
*not* fall under the heading of "derived work."
