# AVR Interrupt-Driven UART with stdio redirect

## Overview

Uart is an interactive command line program that demonstrates stdio redirect of a interrupt-driven UART for AVR. 

## Firmware Upload

The manager needs to be told that it has a localhost and the address to bootload. I do this with some commands on the SMBus interface from an R-Pi.

``` 
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools python3-smbus
sudo usermod -a -G i2c your_user_name
# logout for the change to take
python3
import smbus
bus = smbus.SMBus(1)
#write_i2c_block_data(I2C_ADDR, I2C_COMMAND, DATA)
#read_i2c_block_data(I2C_ADDR, I2C_COMMAND, NUM_OF_BYTES)
# what is my address
bus.write_i2c_block_data(42, 0, [255])
print("'"+chr(bus.read_i2c_block_data(42, 0, 2)[1])+"'" )
'2'
# I want to bootload address '1'
bus.write_i2c_block_data(42, 3, [ord('1')])
print("'"+chr(bus.read_i2c_block_data(42, 3, 2)[1])+"'" )
'1'
# clear the host lockout status bit so nRTS from my R-Pi on '2' will triger the bootloader on '1'
bus.write_i2c_block_data(42, 7, [0])
print(bus.read_i2c_block_data(42,7, 2))
[7, 0]
exit()
```

Now the serial port connection (see BOOTLOAD_PORT in Makefile) can reset the MCU and execute optiboot so that the 'make bootload' rule can upload a new binary image in the application area of flash memory.

``` 
sudo apt-get install make git picocom gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude
git clone https://github.com/epccs/MacGyver/
cd /MacGyver/Applications/Uart
make all
make updi
...
avrdude done.  Thank you.
``` 

Now connect with picocom (or ilk).

``` 
#exit is C-a, C-x
picocom -b 38400 /dev/ttyAMA0
#picocom -b 38400 /dev/ttyUSB0
``` 


# Commands

Commands are interactive over the serial interface at 38400 baud rate. The echo will start after the second character of a new line. 


## /\[rpu_address\]/\[command \[arg\]\]

rpu_address is taken from themanager (e.g. get_Rpu_address() which is included form ../lib/rpu_mgr.h). The value of rpu_address is used as a character in a string, which means don't use a null value (C strings are null terminated) as an adddress. The ASCII value for '1' (0x31) is easy and looks nice, though I fear it will cause some confusion when it is discovered that the actual address value is 49.

Commands and their arguments follow.

## /0/id? \[name|desc|avr-gcc\]

identify 

``` 
/0/id?
{"id":{"name":"Uart","desc":"Gravimetric (17341^0) Board /w ATmega324pb","avr-gcc":"5.4.0"}}
```
